  { value: '2500-5000', label: '$2,500 - $5,000/month', midpoint: 3750 },
  { value: '5000-7500', label: '$5,000 - $7,500/month', midpoint: 6250 },
  { value: '7500-10000', label: '$7,500 - $10,000/month', midpoint: 8750 },
  { value: '10000+', label: '$10,000+/month', midpoint: 12000 }
];

const durationRanges = [
  { value: '6-12', label: '6-12 months ago', midpoint: 9 },
  { value: '12-24', label: '1-2 years ago', midpoint: 18 },
  { value: '24+', label: 'More than 2 years ago', midpoint: 30 }
];
```

### LinkScore Algorithm (DEFINITIVE)
```javascript
// Performance Score (40% weight)
// Competitive Score (35% weight)  
// Opportunity Score (25% weight)

function calculateLinkScore(performanceData, competitiveData, linkGapData) {
  const performanceScore = calculatePerformanceScore(
    performanceData.authorityLinksGained, 
    performanceData.expectedLinks
  );
  
  const competitiveScore = calculateCompetitiveScore(
    competitiveData.clientAuthorityLinks,
    competitiveData.averageCompetitorLinks
  );
  
  const opportunityScore = calculateOpportunityScore(linkGapData.totalGaps);
  
  const finalScore = (performanceScore * 0.40) + 
                     (competitiveScore * 0.35) + 
                     (opportunityScore * 0.25);
  
  return Math.round(finalScore * 10) / 10;
}
```

### Security Framework - 3 Layers

#### Layer 1: Cloudflare (Edge Protection)
- Block high-volume attacks (threat score > 10)
- Rate limit: 3 requests per hour at edge
- Challenge non-Australian traffic
- Block SQL injection patterns

#### Layer 2: Database Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Multiple rate limit checks
await checkRateLimit(ip, 'submission_ip', 3, 60); // 3 per hour per IP
await checkRateLimit(email, 'submission_email', 1, 1440); // 1 per day per email  
await checkRateLimit(domain, 'submission_domain', 1, 1440); // 1 per day per domain
```

#### Layer 3: Input Validation
- Domain sanitization (remove protocols, validate FQDN)
- Block suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, .cf, .ga, .pw)
- Text sanitization with DOMPurify
- SQL injection pattern blocking

### Adaptive CTA Strategy
```javascript
// LinkScore <= 4: CRISIS
{
  type: 'CRISIS',
  headline: 'Your SEO Isn\'t Working',
  cta: 'Get a Free Emergency SEO Audit',
  urgency: 'HIGH',
  leadType: 'PRIORITY'
}

// LinkScore 5-6: OPPORTUNITY
{
  type: 'OPPORTUNITY',
  headline: 'Your SEO Has Potential',
  cta: 'Discover Your Biggest Link Building Opportunities',
  urgency: 'MEDIUM',
  leadType: 'NURTURE'
}

// LinkScore >= 8: SUCCESS
{
  type: 'SUCCESS',
  headline: 'Your SEO Is Working Well',
  cta: 'Book a Strategy Session to Analyze New Opportunities',
  urgency: 'LOW',
  leadType: 'POTENTIAL'
}
```

### DataForSEO API Integration Pattern
```javascript
class RobustAPIClient {
  maxRetries = 3;
  timeoutMs = 30000;
  
  // Retry logic with exponential backoff
  // Authority link filtering with consistent criteria
  // Competitor discovery with fallback strategies
  // Link gap analysis
  // Error handling with user-friendly messages
}

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests (Current Only)

### ✅ **TASK COMPLETED** - Competitor Domain Blocking Implementation

**Status**: Task 6 COMPLETE - Successfully implemented competitor domain blocking
**Goal**: ✅ Improved analysis quality by filtering out non-competitive directory sites
**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ Added COMPETITOR_BLOCKLIST constant with 18 domain variations (www + non-www)
- ✅ Created isBlockedCompetitor() method for efficient domain checking
- ✅ Integrated blocking logic into both live competitor search and fallback competitors
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for transparency and debugging
- ✅ Exported blocklist constant for potential future use in other components
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated blocklist to include both www and non-www versions since DataForSEO API returns domains with both variations
**Domains Successfully Blocked**: localsearch.com.au, yellowpages.com.au, airtasker.com, hipages.com.au, clutch.co, semrush.com, trustpilot.com, productreview.com.au, reddit.com (both www and non-www versions)
**Result**: Analysis now focuses on legitimate business competitors only, improving lead quality and competitive insights

### 🎯 **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED** - All Critical Issues RESOLVED ✅

**Status**: Analysis pipeline now works **END-TO-END** from 0% to 100% completion!

### **🔧 Final Database Issue RESOLVED (JSONB Casting)**
**🚨 Final Blocker**: Analysis completing perfectly (LinkScore: 9/100) but failing at 95% with JSONB casting errors
**💡 Root Cause**: JavaScript objects passed directly to PostgreSQL JSONB columns without proper serialization
**✅ FINAL SOLUTION**: 
```javascript
// BEFORE (failing):
competitors = $14,           // JavaScript object -> PostgreSQL error

// AFTER (working):  
const competitorsJson = JSON.stringify(result.competitors);
competitors = $14::jsonb,    // Properly serialized JSON + casting
```

### **✅ Complete Resolution Summary:**
1. **Background Analysis Starting** ✅ - Fixed `waitUntil` local development issue
2. **UUID Casting in Raw SQL** ✅ - Added `::uuid` casting to all WHERE clauses  
3. **JSONB Data Serialization** ✅ - Added `JSON.stringify()` + `::jsonb` casting
4. **Property Reference Fixes** ✅ - Corrected `result.linkScore.overall` structure
5. **Connection Pooling** ✅ - Optimized for paid Supabase (25 connections, 90s timeout)
6. **Prepared Statement Bypass** ✅ - Complete raw SQL approach eliminates conflicts

### **🧪 Ready for Testing:**
- **Analysis Flow**: 0% → Background process starts → DataForSEO API calls → LinkScore calculation → 95% → **100% SUCCESS**
- **Database Persistence**: All analysis results properly saved to Supabase
- **Webhook Delivery**: Zapier integration triggered on completion
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff

**🚀 Status**: Production-ready database infrastructure for concurrent users on paid Supabase

## Future Enhancements & Considerations (Consolidated)

### Post-MVP Features (NOT for initial launch)
- Admin dashboard for lead monitoring
- PDF report generation with charts
- Email automation for analysis delivery
- Advanced competitor tracking
- Historical trend analysis
- API usage optimization
- Multi-language support
- White-label options

### Technical Debt to Monitor
- Tailwind v4 compatibility issues
- DataForSEO API cost optimization
- Database query performance
- Mobile device testing coverage
- Error tracking implementation

## Master Lessons Learned (Consolidated)

### Vercel Deployment with Prisma (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Vercel caches dependencies which prevents Prisma client auto-generation during builds
- **Error**: "Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies. This leads to an outdated Prisma Client"
- **Solution**: Update build script in package.json from `"build": "next build"` to `"build": "prisma generate && next build"`
- **Additional**: Fix any TypeScript interface compatibility issues that may arise in webhook routes
- **Reference**: https://pris.ly/d/vercel-build

### Development Guidelines
- Mobile-first is non-negotiable for 70%+ mobile traffic
- Form completion rate > feature complexity
- External API dependencies need robust error handling
- Australian privacy compliance is table stakes
- Use range selectors instead of exact inputs for better UX
- Implement comprehensive logging from day one
- Test on real mobile devices, not just browser DevTools

### Business Requirements
- Authority links must meet strict criteria (DR≥20, Spam≤30%, Traffic≥750)
- Lead quality more important than lead volume
- Adaptive messaging based on LinkScore crucial for conversions
- Company/phone collection at END reduces abandonment
- Real-time progress updates prevent analysis abandonment
- Webhook integration enables immediate sales follow-up
- Cost efficiency ($1.22/lead) makes this highly scalable

### Zapier Webhook Integration (NEW)
- **Environment Setup**: Use `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` for Zapier webhooks, `CRM_WEBHOOK_URL` for CRM systems
- **Automatic Triggering**: Webhooks trigger automatically in `finalizeAnalysis()` method after successful completion
- **Retry Logic Essential**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) handles network failures effectively  
- **Timeout Handling**: Use AbortController with 15-second timeout for reliability
- **Dual Endpoint Support**: Can send to multiple webhooks simultaneously (Zapier + CRM)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all webhook attempts for monitoring and debugging
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling prevents blocking analysis completion
- **Payload Structure**: Full analysis data including LinkScore, competitive data, and lead scoring

### Security Implementation
- Never store plain text PII
- Implement rate limiting at multiple layers
- Validate and sanitize ALL user inputs
- Log security events for monitoring
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement HTTPS everywhere
- Regular security audits required

### Competitor Analysis Quality Control (NEW)
- **Directory Domain Blocking**: Directory-type domains (yellowpages.com.au, localsearch.com.au, etc.) are not true competitors and should be filtered out
- **Implementation Pattern**: Use Set-based blocklist with isBlocked() helper method for O(1) lookup performance
- **Filter Integration**: Apply blocking logic in both live API competitor search AND fallback competitors
- **Logging Strategy**: Log all blocked domains with clear reasoning for transparency and debugging
- **Maintenance**: Keep blocklist as exportable constant for potential use in other analysis components
- **Business Impact**: Filtering directory domains significantly improves competitive analysis accuracy and lead quality
